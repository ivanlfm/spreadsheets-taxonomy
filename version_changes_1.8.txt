version 1.8 -- 2021/09/16
	MaterialExamined
	* added columns for host and literal label
	* fixed small bugs that prevented correct printing of the material list when consecutive rows had the same information in some cells (e.g. Argentina, Córdoba and Spain, Córdoba)
	(this was not added to the EJT version... beware!)

version 1.7 -- 2021/04/28
	MaterialExamined + Descriptions:
	* replaced ISBLANK() by COUNTBLANK()=1; COUNTBLANK counts both truly empty cells, as well as cells filled with formulas returning ""; thus now the spreadsheets work better if your original data was generated using formmulas.
	
	MaterialExamined:
	*added a custom sheet that generates lists in the format for the European Journal of Taxonomy

version 1.6 -- 2020/05/11

	MaterialExamined:
	* Made pooling more efficient by removing lastpool and reworking the formula in matex to no longer require INDEX(MATCH)
	
version 1.5 -- 2020/05/06
thanks to Abel Bustamante, Priscila Hanisch, Willians Porto, Alexander Orfinger and Shlomo Cain for feedback and suggestions

	General fixes
	* MaterialExamined and Description now trim and fix small formatting issues in the list/final description (double spaces, double commas, etc.)
	* Added full citation to ReadMe
	* Changed all VLOOKUP to INDEX(MATCH) for improved precision

	MaterialExamined:
	* Fixed the B5–B7 formulas in MaterialExamined data sheet, which were lacking and could cause errors in printing records of these rows
	* Added sheet "type-categories" to MaterialExamined; users can now add new type categories manually
	* Added "Allotype" to list of type categories
	* Reworked helper columns, removed checkup and checkdown, added composedloc, composedrecord, etc
	* Users can now define the separator following countries (default .) and 1st level administrative units (default :)
	* Fixed the matex formula, which in some instances failed to print method/habitat/date/collector when it was the same in consecutive in the same rows, even if it was from different collecting events
	* Improved some formatting issues (now it puts the comma in admin2 outside the tags; uses comma instead of semicolon for consecutive localities in same admin2)
	* Now has a "verbose" option for printing "same collector", "same date" and "same collector and date" so these instances can be differentiated from absences of data
	* Now has a pool option that allows summing of individuals of the same locality for a more condensed list format

	Variation:
	* Fixed missing formulas in Variation data sheet interval E23:G26
